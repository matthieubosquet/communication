# Solid World Strategy 

This is a document detailing the Solid World webinar strategy including elements such as a record of the Solid World template agenda and a place to co-create suggestions on how to improve Solid World as well as a record of ideas for future editions. 

Solid World is a webinar held on the first Thursday of every month. Up to date information about Solid World, including the agenda for the next edition and recordings of past additions, is published on [this page](https://solidproject.org/events).
